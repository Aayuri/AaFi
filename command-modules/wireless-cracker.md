## Interfaces:

Depending on the interface you plan to use for the attack in my case `wlan0` and `wlan1` were my options to use.  Usually those are the most common interfaces to use and choose from when running any of these attacks in the module. 

## Types of Attacks:

* `WPS Attack` -  The attack works by executing a brute-force attack against the WPS PIN.
* `WPA/WPA2 Attack` - Creates a `.cap` file for the user to read with a specific BSSID. 
* `CAP Bruteforce` - The attack works by executing a brute-force attack against all possible passcodes using a massive wordlist that is provided in the download. However, you can customize the wordlist to make it other wordlists while trying to crack the network.
