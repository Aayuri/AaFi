## What is our goals for AaFi?

What I want my tool AaFi to accompish in the end by being open source anyone can add to the tool. Which means if someone later down the line wants to use this for their capstone or anything alike you can and go off the code I have and build something even better of AaFi. I want to future proof AaFi and keep it updated as much as possible as a ongoing project that continues to evolve overtime.
