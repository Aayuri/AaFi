## What is our goals for AaFi?

What I want my tool AaFi to accompish in the end by being open source anyone can add to the tool. Which means if someone later down the line wants to use this for their capstone or anything alike you can and go off the code I have and build something even better of AaFi. I want to future proof AaFi and keep it updated as much as possible as a ongoing project that continues to evolve overtime.

## What was learned throughout developing AaFi?

For the most part about 90% percent of the things I planned went right as far I foresee this project to go. However, most of the issues that I fixed or changed can be found in [Challenges Working on AaFi](challenges-working-on-aafi.md) and [AaFi Changelogs](../aafi-changelogs.md). My original goal was to create a tool and compile a whole bunch of tools into one package that makes it easier for the user to do. With a couple of issues that were later fixed throughout the process of making this tool. Everything I looked initially at the beginning ended up working out at the end of the project. I learned how to compile shell scripts through this and brushed up my knowledge with python and other languages this tool uses.
