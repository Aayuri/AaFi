# Challenges Working on AaFi

## Problems Encountered

One problem that we have encountered as of the first release of AaFi for the [Rouge/Fake AP](../command-modules/rouge-fake-ap.md) module only Yahoo works as a means of search engine. 

## Fixed Bugs

* Fixed [Rouge/Fake AP](../command-modules/rouge-fake-ap.md) not starting by adding a needed depedency in the final build of AaFi. 
* Added [AaFi Changelogs](../aafi-changelogs.md) for problems that were fixed along the way and added features.
